# Haze Neural Architecture

## Overview

Haze is a continuously learning, self-organizing neural mesh designed to evolve into a general intelligence system. Unlike traditional neural networks with static layers and fixed architectures, Haze is built from modular components that dynamically grow, adapt, and connect in flexible, directional ways.

Haze supports a variety of input and output modalities (text, images, time series, etc.) and allows for interpreters to translate between raw data and neural stimulation or responses. It learns in real time, through sparse updates based on recent activity and feedback, enabling it to evolve continuously without explicit training cycles.

## Core Concepts

### Neuron Types
- Sensor Neurons: Receive input via modular input interpreters.
- Interneurons: Abstract and relay information through weighted, directional connections.
- Motor Neurons: Activate output interpreters to produce meaningful results.

### Connections
- Directional and weighted (asymmetric)
- Can represent non-physical relationships
- Form a conceptual mesh instead of spatial layers

### Interpreters
- Input Interpreters: Convert raw external data (e.g., text, image pixels) into sensor neuron stimulation.
- Output Interpreters: Translate motor neuron activations into usable formats (e.g., words, numbers, actions).
- Interpreters are modular, allowing multimodal interaction with the same underlying network.

### Learning
- Based on discrepancy between actual output and expected output (reward signal)
- Only recently activated neurons and their connections are updated
- Unused or misfiring neurons are reset (not deleted) to avoid orphaned components
- Enables real-time learning without discrete epochs

### Mesh Structure
- Not tied to spatial coordinates or fixed layers
- Topologically connected through abstract associations
- Grows dynamically as new data types, tokens, or patterns are encountered

## Modular Components

### Input Interpreters

Responsible for translating domain-specific data into neuron activations

Examples: TextInterpreter, ImageInterpreter, TimeSeriesInterpreter

Can dynamically spawn new sensor neurons as needed

Output Interpreters

Interpret motor activations according to a task

Examples: ArgMax, Regressor, SoftMax, VectorInterpreter, SequentialInterpreter

Can support abstract outputs (e.g., text → vector, image → emotion)

Learning Engine

Applies updates based on recent activations and reward signal

Sparse: only updates directly involved connections

Can run synchronously or asynchronously (e.g., background consolidation)

Activation Memory

Tracks which neurons and connections were involved in recent decisions

Used for determining which paths are eligible for learning

Pruning and Resetting

Neurons are never deleted

If unused, they are reset to avoid destabilizing the mesh

Prevents orphaned sensors and maintains network continuity

## Data Flow

Input Interpreter encodes data into sensor neuron activations

Activations propagate through interneurons

Motor neurons activate

Output Interpreter decodes activations into meaningful output

Reward is computed as discrepancy between output and target

Learning Engine updates only recently active connections

## Lifelong Learning Cycle

Every interaction is an opportunity to learn

Interpreters can evolve or be replaced without disrupting core network

Knowledge is accumulated across tasks

The mesh grows over time — new neurons are added, existing ones adapt

Haze is designed not as a task-specific model, but as a continuously growing substrate for intelligence. Its modular design, real-time learning, and open-ended adaptability aim to make it capable of general-purpose reasoning across domains, data types, and contexts.
